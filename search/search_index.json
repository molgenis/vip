INFO/CSQ/VKGL_CL string VEP plugin VKGL consensus variant classification Details \u00b6 VIP uses the Ensemble Effect Predictor to annotate all variants with their consequences. We use VEP with the refseq option for the transcripts, and with the flags for sift and polyphen annotations enabled. Plugins \u00b6 Below we describe the other sources which we annotate using the VEP plugin framework. CAPICE \u00b6 CAPICE is a computational method for predicting the pathogenicity of SNVs and InDels. It is a gradient boosting tree model trained using a variety of genomic annotations used by CADD score and trained on the clinical significance. CAPICE performs consistently across diverse independent synthetic, and real clinical data sets. It ourperforms the current best method in pathogenicity estimation for variants of different molecular consequences and allele frequency. We run the CAPICE application in the VIP pipeline and use a VEP plugin to annotate the VEP output with the scores from the CAPICE output file. VKGL \u00b6 The datashare workgroup of VKGL has set up a central database to enable mutual sharing of variant classifications through a partly automatic process. An additional goal is the public sharing of these data. The currently publicly available part of the database consists of DNA variant classifications established based on (former) diagnostic questions. We add the classifications from an export of the database and use a VEP plugin to annotate the VEP output with the classifications from the this file. SpliceAI \u00b6 SpliceAI is an open-source deep learning splicing prediction algorithm that has demonstrated in the past few years its high ability to predict splicing defects caused by DNA variations. We add the scores from the available precomputed scores of SpliceAI and use a copy of the available VEP plugin to annotate the VEP output with the classifications from the this file. AnnotSV \u00b6 AnnotSV is a program for annotating and ranking structural variations from genomes of several organisms. We run the AnnotSV application in the VIP pipeline and use a VEP plugin to annotate the VEP output with the scores from the AnnotSV output file. HPO \u00b6 A file based on the HPO phenotype_to_genes.txt is used to annotate VEP consequences with the inheritance modes associated with the gene of this consequence. Inheritance \u00b6 A file based on the CGD database is used to annotate VEP consequences with the inheritance modes associated with the gene of this consequence. Grantham \u00b6 The Grantham score attempts to predict the distance between two amino acids, in an evolutionary sense. A lower Grantham score reflects less evolutionary distance. A higher Grantham score reflects a greater evolutionary distance. We use a copy of the VEP plugin by Duarte Molha to annotate the VEP output with Grantham scores. GADO \u00b6 GADO can be used to prioritize genes based on the HPO terms of a patient.. We run the GADO commandline application in the VIP pipeline and use a VEP plugin to annotate the VEP output with the scores from the GADO output file. AlphScore \u00b6 AlphScore is a method to predict the pathogenicity of missense variants using features derived from AlphaFold2. We add the available precomputed scores of AlphScore using a custom VEP plugin. ncER \u00b6 The non-coding essential regulation (ncER) score indicates if a region is likely to be essential in terms of regulation. The ncER file VIP uses is the version provided by GREEN-VARAN (https://github.com/edg1983/GREEN-VARAN) on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/5636163 If overlapping regions are encountered (which can occur in liftovered resources) the highest score is annotated. ReMM \u00b6 The Regulatory Mendelian Mutation (ReMM) score was created for relevance prediction of non-coding variations (SNVs and small InDels) in the human genome (hg19) in terms of Mendelian diseases. The VEP plugin is build on top of the GREEN-DB dataset (GRCh38) for ReMM scores: https://zenodo.org/records/3955933 If overlapping regions are encountered (which can occur in liftovered resources) the highest score is annotated. FATHMM-MKL \u00b6 FATHMM-MKL predicts the Functional Consequences of Coding and Non-Coding Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) This plugin annotates non-coding scores only, and is build on top of the GREEN-DB dataset (GRCh38) for FATHMM-MKL non coding scores: https://zenodo.org/records/3981121 GREEN-DB constraint scores \u00b6 GREEN-DB GREEN-DB is a comprehensive collection of 2.4 million regulatory elements in the human genome collected from previously published databases, high-throughput screenings and functional studies. This plugin annotates the constrain scores only, and is build on top of the GREEN-DB bed files ( GRCh38): https://zenodo.org/records/5636209 GREEN-DB constrains scores are annotated per region type: enhancers, promotors, bivalent, insulators, silencers. If multiple regions of the same type overlap, VIP annotates the highest constraint score.","title":"Annotations"},{"location":"advanced/annotations/#annotations","text":"VIP annotates variant effects and genotype data for samples using a rich set of tools.

Why does VIP fail with an Unexpected Error [InvocationTargetException] ? \u00b6 This issue can mean a number of things, check the .nxf.log for more details.

The fastq workflow is an extension of the cram workflow. The cram and gvcf workflows are extensions of the vcf workflow. The vcf workflow produces the pipeline outputs as described here . The following sections provide an overview of the steps of each of these workflows. FASTQ \u00b6 The fastq workflow consists of the following steps: Parallelize sample sheet per sample and for each sample Quality reporting and preprocessing using fastp Alignment using minimap2 producing a cram file per sample In case of multiple fastq files per sample, concatenate the cram output files Continue with step 3. of the cram workflow For details, see here . CRAM \u00b6 The cram workflow consists of the following steps: Parallelize sample sheet per sample and for each sample Create validated, indexed .bam file from bam/cram/sam input Generate coverage metrics using MosDepth , using the the regions file provided in the sample sheet if present. If no regions file is provided a default .bed file will be used containing all exons in case of WES data, and all genes in case of WGS data.

Using this fork of Straglr for PacBio and Nanopore long read data, this is a fork of this fork(https://github.com/philres/straglr) and is chosen over the original Straglr because of the VCF output that enables VIP to combine it with the SV and SNV data in the VCF workflow.

Parallelize cram in chunks consisting of one or more contigs and for each chunk Perform short variant calling with DeepVariant producing a gvcf file per chunk per sample, the gvcfs of the samples in a project are than merged to one vcf per project (using GLnexus and phased using Whatshap .

Concatenate short variant calling and structural variant calling vcf files per chunk per sample Continue with step 3. of the vcf workflow For details, see here . 1): In case of projects containing pedigree information the phasing requires the bam/cram/sam file to have readgroup information in order to be able to determine which reads belong to which family member. Phasing is skipped if this information is not present. gVCF \u00b6 The gvcf workflow consists of the following steps: For each project in the sample sheet Create validated, indexed .g.vcf.gz file from bcf/bcf.gz/bcf.bgz/gvcf/gvcf.gz/gvcf.bgz/vcf/vcf.gz/vcf.bgz inputs Merge .g.vcf.gz files using GLnexus resulting in one vcf.gz per project Continue with step 3. of the vcf workflow For details, see here .
